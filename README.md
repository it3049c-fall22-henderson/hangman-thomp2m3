## Self-Evaluation:

How many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 20/20

## Self-Reflection:

This assignment was pretty challenging for me in a few aspects.  I spent a pretty good amount of time coming up with some logic to compare the values in each array, that I eventually landed on nested for loops.  Getting the positioning to look appropriate on the Canvas took some time as well, a lot of trial and error.  One of the coolest aspects was after all the logic was complete and I was able to dabble into animate.css class and learning about keyframes to create the animations.  By far the most challenging assignment thus far.

### How long it took me to finish this?

~10 hours.  I worked on this over the course of three (3) weeknights.
